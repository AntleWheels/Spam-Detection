I developed a **Spam Detection System** using Python, NLTK, and machine learning. This prototype uses advanced preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal to classify messages with an impressive accuracy of **98.56%**. ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

This project helped me deepen my understanding of:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Data cleaning and visualization with pandas and matplotlib
- Building efficient machine learning pipelines

ðŸ’¡ Looking forward to feedback and connecting with like-minded professionals. Let me know what you think! ðŸŒŸ
